## üé¨ Next Steps

### 1. Review the Environment Variables
```bash
# Open and read through:
.env.example
```
**Action**: Decide which APIs you want to start with

### 2. Sign Up for APIs
**Start with these (Critical)**:
- [ ] [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/) - Sports odds ($50/month or free)
- [ ] [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) - AI analysis (~$20-50/month)
- [ ] [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) - Web search ($50/month or free)

**See `APEX_API_GUIDE.md` for full list**

### 3. Deploy to Railway

**Option A: GitHub (Recommended)**
```bash
# 1. Push your code to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main

# 2. Go to Railway
# Visit: https://railway.app/new
# Click: "Deploy from GitHub repo"
# Select your repository
```

**Option B: CLI**
```bash
# 1. Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# 2. Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### 4. Add Environment Variables in Railway
```bash
# In Railway Dashboard:
# Your Project ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí Variables

# Add each API key:
NODE_ENV=production
ODDS_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
# ... (see .env.example for full list)
```

### 5. Add Database
```bash
# In Railway Dashboard:
# Click "+ New" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL"
# DATABASE_URL is automatically set
```

### 6. Generate Domain
