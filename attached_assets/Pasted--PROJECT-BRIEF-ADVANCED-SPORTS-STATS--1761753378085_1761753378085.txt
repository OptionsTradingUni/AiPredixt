PROJECT BRIEF: ADVANCED SPORTS STATS & PREDICTIONS PLATFORM
==============================================================

**GOAL:** Develop a live score, statistics, and betting prediction platform (Web and Mobile App) that is functionally superior and more detailed than Scores24.live, using **FREE and PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA SOURCES ONLY**.

---
SECTION 1: DATA ACQUISITION (THE ENGINE) - ***REVISED FOR FREE DATA***
---

The project foundation will rely on a combination of free APIs and managed web scraping. This approach introduces **significantly higher maintenance requirements** and **legal/reliability risks** compared to paid APIs.

**1. Data Acquisition Strategy (Free/Public Sources):**
* **Primary (Scores/Basic Stats/Historical):** Use known **Free Tier APIs** like **TheSportsDB** or **API-FOOTBALL (API-Sports)**. These offer limited, delayed, or basic data (e.g., updates every 15-60 seconds, limited requests).
* **Odds Data:** This is the most difficult. Must rely on scraping from major free odds comparison sites (e.g., using Python/Scrapy to scrape a few key bookmakers' odds daily) or utilizing free data feeds if any can be secured.
* **Advanced Data (xG/xA):** Must use targeted scraping of dedicated free statistical websites like **Understat.com**, **FBRef.com**, or **Infogol.net**. This data is essential but will not be real-time.
* **Injury Data:** Must be sourced by scraping team news pages, forums, or a reliable free source. This will be the least reliable data point.

**2. Data Requirements & Source Mapping:**
* **Live Scores & Schedule:** Free Tier API (e.g., API-Sports/TheSportsDB). ***(High Risk of Delays)***
* **Comprehensive Stats:** Combination of Free Tier API and scraped data from WhoScored/FBRef.
* **Betting Odds Feed:** Targeted scraping of comparison/bookmaker sites. ***(Highest Risk of Ban/Breakage)***
* **Historical Data (5 yrs):** Scraped from public statistical sites.
* **Advanced Data (xG/xA/xPTS):** Scraped from Understat/FBRef.

**3. Action Item (Agent):**
* **Create a robust multi-source data pipeline** using Python (Scrapy/BeautifulSoup/Selenium) to gather, clean, and consolidate data from all identified free sources.
* **Implement IP rotation and "human" scraping patterns** to mitigate the high risk of IP bans from source websites.
* **Set up monitoring alerts** for when a scraping job fails (due to website structural changes).

---
SECTION 2: BACKEND ARCHITECTURE & LOGIC
---

**1. Core Technology Stack (Suggested):**
* **Backend:** Python (Django/Flask) - *Python is ideal for its strong scraping and data science libraries.*
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (for relational data integrity) or MongoDB (for flexibility).

**2. Match Structure Logic (Crucial for Display ALL Games):**
* The backend MUST process and structure the data to display **ALL** scheduled games, correctly **grouped by league**.
    * **Endpoint Example:** `/api/v1/matches/upcoming` should return a nested object/array where the first level is grouped by `League Name` and the second level lists the individual matches.
    * **Example Structure:** `[{ "league_name": "Serie A", "matches": [...] }, { "league_name": "UCL", "matches": [...] }]`

**3. Proprietary Prediction Engine (The "More Detailed" Feature):**
* Develop custom algorithms that run daily to analyze **all** available games and generate automated predictions.
* **Required Models:**
    * **Match Result/Moneyline:** Uses H2H, Form, and xG to calculate Win/Draw/Loss percentages.
    * **Totals/Overs & Unders:** Uses team xG and defensive xG to predict final goal count ranges.
    * **Specialty Models:** Develop models for **Corner Predictions** (e.g., Team Over 5.5 Corners) and **Card/Booking Predictions**.
* **Output:** The engine must generate a clear, data-driven **RATIONALE** (supporting statistics) for every automated prediction.

**4. Editorial CMS:**
* Implement a simple Content Management System (CMS) for editors to input human-written content.
    * **Content:** "Editorial Prediction" text, deep analysis, and any unique match insights that supplement the automated data.

---
SECTION 3: FRONTEND & USER EXPERIENCE (UX)
---

**1. Technology Stack (Suggested):**
* **Frontend:** React, Vue, or a mobile-first framework like React Native/Flutter.
* **Design:** Must be modern, clean, and prioritizing **mobile-first** responsiveness.

**2. Main Page / Schedule View:**
* **League Demarcation:** The primary view must clearly display **ALL** upcoming games, separated by large, distinct **League Headers** (e.g., "Serie A," "Copa del Rey," etc.).
* **Prediction Summary:** Each match card should include a small indicator if a prediction is available and display the consensus or top tip.

**3. Detailed Match View (Tabbed Interface):**
* Implement a clear tab navigation bar for efficient data access.
* **Required Tabs & Content:**
    * **Overview:** Basic info, live score, top odds, referee.
    * **Prediction:** (The most important tab) Must display:
        * **Editorial Prediction** (text from CMS).
        * **Injury/Squad Report** (from data feed/CMS).
        * **Prediction Matrix:** A list of all automated predictions (Match Result, O/U, BTTS, Corners, etc.), each with **clear supporting statistics** (e.g., "9 of last 10 home games...").
    * **H2H:** Head-to-Head results, often split into 'ALL', 'Home/Away', and 'Away/Home'.
    * **Standings/Form:** Full league table and last 5-10 match results for both teams.
    * **Stats:** Deep dive into seasonal and recent team performance (xG, xA, possession, shots per game).
    * **Odds:** Full table of odds from all integrated bookmakers for various markets (Moneyline, Handicap, Totals).

---
SECTION 4: KEY DELIVERABLES
---

1.  Documentation of all **free data sources** used and the implemented **scraping/API plan**.
2.  Complete API documentation for the custom backend endpoints.
3.  Working prototype demonstrating the **league-demarcated match list** showing **all games**.
4.  Prototype of the **Prediction Tab** showing automated tips with supporting rationale and human-input editorial content.

---
SECTION 5: ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS & UNIQUE FEATURES
---

**A. User Engagement Features:**
* **'Bet Builder' Feature:** Allow users to save custom multi-leg parlays/accumulators and track their win probability based on the platform's models.
* **Prediction Voting:** Add the "Will this prediction come true?" YES/NO voting feature to gather user engagement data and provide social proof.
* **User-Generated Content:** Allow registered users to submit their own brief predictions or comments on a match page.

**B. Data Quality/Display Enhancements:**
* **"Luck" Index:** Create a proprietary index based on (Actual Goals - xG) to highlight teams that are due for positive or negative variance. Display this index prominently on the team's Form/Stats tab.
* **"Sharp vs. Public" Odds Display:** Use the scraped odds to identify large price movements and indicate if the *sharp* (professional) money is moving against the general *public* opinion.
* **Data Refresh Indicator:** Clearly display the timestamp of the last data update (especially crucial since you are using non-real-time free data) to manage user expectations.

**C. Maintenance & Risk Mitigation:**
* **Separate Scraping Module:** The scraping logic must be isolated from the main application, allowing it to be easily updated or replaced when source websites inevitably change their structure.
* **Data Validation Layer:** Implement checks to discard scraped data that looks corrupt, ensuring the prediction models are never fed bad information.
