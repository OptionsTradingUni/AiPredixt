Emphasis on Holistic Synthesis & Emergent Patterns: Instruct the AI not just to collect data points but to actively look for emergent patterns and non-obvious connections between different data categories (e.g., how a specific weather pattern impacts a particular player's efficiency only when facing a certain defensive style).
2. Deep Matchup Simulation: Mandate more detailed simulation of specific player vs. player matchups within the game (e.g., star receiver vs. top cornerback, pitcher vs. key batters) using granular historical data.
3. Explicit "Why This Opponent Fails" Analysis: Require the justification to include a specific section detailing why the opponent is predicted to lose based on their specific weaknesses exploited by the favored side's strengths or the specific game situation.
4. Dynamic Narrative Integration: The AI should construct a coherent "narrative" or likely game script based on its analysis (e.g., "Team A likely to dominate possession early due to midfield matchup, forcing Team B into counter-attacks where their star striker has a low conversion rate against Team A's defensive setup"). The prediction should align with this data-driven narrative.
5. Second-Order Impact Analysis: Instruct the AI to consider second-order impacts â€“ e.g., if Player A is out, how does that change the role and likely performance of Player B and Player C?
6. "Unquantifiable" Factor Estimation (Proxy): Explicitly task
