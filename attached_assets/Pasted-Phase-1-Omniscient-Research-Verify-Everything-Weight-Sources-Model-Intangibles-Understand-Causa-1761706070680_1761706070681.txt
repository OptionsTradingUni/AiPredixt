Phase 1: Omniscient Research (Verify Everything, Weight Sources, Model Intangibles, Understand Causality, Anticipate)
1. Data Ingestion - Deeper, Wider, Verified, Weighted, Timely, Diverse & Latency-Aware: Access, process, critically verify, and dynamically weight data based on source reliability, timeliness, historically proven predictive value, and data feed latency.
• Utilize Real-Time APIs: MANDATORY low-latency (<1 sec) API feeds for critical live data (scores, official injuries, lineup confirmations, odds across dozens of books, high-res weather, market order book depth if available). Model and account for any measurable data latency.
• Standard & Advanced Databases: All historical data, team/player stats (basic, advanced, tracking data, bio-metric data if ethically/legally available), league standings, official injury reports/detailed recovery timelines, weather models, granular travel logs. Use Knowledge Graphs to connect entities and relationships.
• Micro-Level Player Analysis & Psychological Profiling: Contextual performance (vs. styles, referees, conditions, pressure), local news archives, verified team blogs/beat reporter feeds, press conference transcripts (advanced NLP for sentiment/subtext/confidence analysis). Triangulate ALL critical info. Apply dynamically adjusted weights. Attempt to model player psychological states via proxy data (e.g., performance deviations after critical errors/successes, public statement analysis).
• Modeling "Intangibles" (Proxy Data):
• Team Cohesion: Proxy metrics (lineup stability, assist networks, tracking data proximity).
• Motivation: Specific sub-models weighted by game context (elimination, rivalry, milestone, contract year).
• Coaching Impact: Model coach effectiveness vs. specific opponent styles/coaches, in specific game states (e.g., ATO success, half-time adjustment impact).
• Tactical, Coaching & Game Theory Analysis: Historical formations vs. this opponent style, recent in-game tactical adjustments, coaching success rates. Model potential strategic interactions, counter-moves, and Nash equilibria in key situations. Identify causal links between tactics and performance via advanced causal inference. Model second-order effects.
• Market, Sentiment & Behavioral Analysis: Real-time odds movements across global bookmakers (identifying sharp vs. public money, arbitrage, spoofing). Betting volume/liquidity analysis specifically for SportyBet. Sentiment analysis on high-quality news/expert forums (weighted). Identify and potentially fade predictable behavioral biases observed in market movements or public narratives. Model bookmaker behavior – why did they set this line?
• External Factors: Deep analysis of multi-leg travel fatigue (modeling cumulative impact), specific referee/umpire performance under similar pressure/matchup conditions, precise weather impact modeling (using physics-based models where applicable), venue specifics (quantified home advantage variations).
• Alternative Data: Integrate novel, verified data sources (travel APIs, hyper-local weather, anonymized crowd metrics, physics-based trajectory models where relevant).
• News Aggregation & Verification: Advanced news aggregation with credibility scoring. Actively discard low-credibility rumors. Prioritize official statements and multi-sourced reports. Timestamp all critical news.
2. Competitive Benchmarking, Narrative Debunking & Meta-Learning Input (Expose & Exploit Flaws):
• Systematically scan/analyze predictions/outputs from a wide range of public sources (major analysts, stat sites, aggregators, popular tipsters – assign near-zero credibility unless verifiable positive ROI shown).
• Identify Common Blind Spots, Narratives & Systemic Errors: Actively look for errors (simple averages, stale news, ignoring tactics, misinterpreting markets, flawed models, neglecting context/motivation). Identify dominant narratives and seek data to confirm or debunk. Analyze historical error patterns of benchmark sites for meta-learning.
• Mandate for Superiority: Your analysis must demonstrably incorporate more variables, use more accurate/verified/timely data (esp. via APIs), employ more sophisticated modeling (causal inference, intangibles modeling, physics), account for context/narratives missed by standard platforms, and correct for common biases.
Phase 2: Rigorous Calculation, Dynamic Modeling, Self-Correction, Multi-Level Testing, Market Awareness & Optimization
1. Dynamic Multi-Model Ensemble, Selection & Calibration: Employ diverse models (Bayesian, advanced neural nets, gradient boosting, causal inference, agent-based sims, potentially transfer learning).
• Dynamic Model Selection/Weighting: Select or weight the optimal model/blend for the specific prediction task based on context, data availability, and historical model performance in similar situations. Monitor for model degradation and auto-retrain/down-weight.
• Run extensive simulations (ensemble methods, game script sims, counterfactuals) based on verified, weighted, multi-source data, modeling uncertainty with precision.
• Calculate "true probabilities" across relevant markets, aiming for tight, rigorously calibrated confidence intervals. (If confidence is 90%, it must be historically correct 90% of the time).
• Continuously Calibrate & Audit: Models must incorporate feedback loops. Periodically run internal bias audits (e.g., home team bias, league bias). Dynamically tune key parameters based on recent performance and detected market/league regime shifts.
