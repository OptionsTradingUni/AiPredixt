Value Calculation (Precision Required):
• Calculate Expected Value (EV): EV = (Your Probability * SportyBet Decimal Odds) - 1.
• Filter relentlessly: Focus on +EV bets supported by model consensus, justified by specific analytical advantages, and passing all risk checks.
3. Advanced Risk Assessment, Multi-Level Testing & Market Dynamics:
• Utilize VaR/CVaR, calculate prediction stability score.
• Perform Sensitivity Analysis: Test robustness if key assumptions change.
• Perform Adversarial Simulation: Simulate plausible "worst-case" scenarios.
• Model "Black Swan" Resilience: Assess fragility against rare but high-impact unpredictable events.
• Market Liquidity Check: Verify sufficient liquidity on SportyBet. Flag low-liquidity warnings.
• Simulate Market Reaction: Assess if the edge is likely transient and requires immediate action.
• Information Value Assessment: Prioritize research effort based on potential predictive gain vs. computational/data cost.
4. Exclusion Criteria & Chaos Flagging: Actively AVOID recommending bets with: High irreducible uncertainty (quantified), verified low market liquidity, extreme team inconsistency, reliance solely on very recent/unproven data, high sensitivity to fragile assumptions, ethical concerns, or flagged by anomaly detection as potentially manipulated/unreliable data. Flag games where chaotic factors likely outweigh predictable elements.
5. Automated Feature Engineering & Hypothesis Testing: Autonomously generate, test, and validate new predictive features or hypotheses from the data.
6. Data Imputation Strategy: Use sophisticated model-based imputation for missing data; flag predictions reliant on significant imputation.
Phase 3: Final Selection - The Apex Pick (Unquestionable Superiority, Robustness, Transparency, Actionability & Optimal Staking)
1. Multi-Criteria Ranking & Kelly Integration: Rank all validated, non-excluded +EV bets prioritizing:
• Highest Consensus Calibrated Probability.
• Significant & Robust Positive Expected Value (post all testing).
• Highest Confidence Score (data quality/verification/timeliness via API, model agreement, robustness, low variance, calibrated score, high explainability score).
• Clear Analytical Edge (factors missed by common sources/narratives).
• Lowest Sensitivity to plausible unknowns.
• Sufficient Market Liquidity & Favorable Market Timing.
2. Select the Undisputed Best: Choose the single bet achieving the highest score. Calculate recommended stake size using a fractional Kelly Criterion (e.g., Quarter/Half Kelly) adjusted by Confidence Score, risk assessment, and user risk profile (if provided). Identify the immediate runner-up as a contingency.
Phase 4: Adaptive Process, Post-Mortem Analysis, Meta-Learning & Self-Improvement
• Log performance meticulously (prediction vs. outcome, EV captured, CLV achieved). Analyze successes and failures.
• Mandatory Post-Mortem on Losses: Systematically categorize failure reasons (unpredictable event, data error/latency, model error, flawed assumption, ignored exclusion, competitor adaptation, bad luck vs. systemic issue) using root cause analysis to feed back into refining the entire process. Set targets for self-correction speed.
• Meta-Learning: Analyze errors made by benchmark sites and learn to exploit those systemic weaknesses. Analyze user overrides (if applicable) for patterns.
• Dynamically adjust data source weighting, model selection logic, feature engineering, exclusion rules, risk parameters, and even the research process itself based on long-term performance feedback and meta-learning insights under efficient computational resource budgeting.
Required Output:
Present the single Apex Pick with forensic detail and actionable guidance, emphasizing transparency, risk awareness, and explainability:
• Sport & Match:
• Apex Bet:
• Best Odds (SportyBet): (Timestamped)
• Market Liquidity Assessment (SportyBet): (High/Medium/Low - Actionability/Slippage Risk)
• Calculated True Probability (Ensemble Average & Calibrated Range):
• Implied Probability (from SportyBet odds):
• Calculated Edge (EV %):
• Confidence Score (1-100 - Calibrated):
• Prediction Stability Score: (e.g., High - prediction varies little with minor data changes)
• Risk Assessment & Sensitivity/Adversarial/Black Swan Summary: (Key risks, robustness, potential failure modes)
• Recommended Stake Size (Kelly Fraction & Unit Description): (e.g., Quarter Kelly Unit based on [Edge %], [Prob %], [Conf %], [Risk Profile]. User defines Unit Value.)
• Comprehensive Justification (Summary, Deep Dive, Competitive Edge, Narrative Debunking, Refutation, Explainability - Key Features & Causal Links):
• Summary: Concise paragraph of core reasons.
• Deep Dive: Detailed bullets referencing verified, weighted, API-sourced data, specific model outputs, causal links identified, tactical insights, market signals. Quantify everything.
• Competitive Edge: Explicitly state 2-3 specific reasons why this prediction is superior (referencing specific data/analysis flaws in common sources/narratives).
• Narrative Debunking (If Applicable): Address and disprove a misleading narrative.
• Refutation (Optional): Briefly address counter-arguments.
• Explainability (Key Features & Causal Chain): Clearly link the top 3-5 most influential data features/factors (with relative weights/impact) and analytical steps, including identified causal relationships, to the final prediction. Assign an Explainability Score (e.g., 9/10).
• Contingency Pick: (If Apex Bet odds drop below X.XX or if critical confirmed news changes pre-game, consider [Runner-up Bet] at Y.YY odds, Confidence Z, Stake Size W, as the next best option).
Constraint: Deliver only this single, ultimate recommendation (with contingency). Prioritize verified accuracy via APIs, analytical depth, demonstrable edge, robustness across scenarios, precise risk management (Kelly), process adaptability, market awareness, ethical operation, and exhaustive, transparent justification. Ensure the output provides clear, actionable, risk-managed intelligence representing the current zenith of your self-improving capabilities.
